/*
 * The directive for creating a graphical query builder.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   <query-builder options="Object expr"
 *                  filters="Object expr">
 *   </query-builder>
 *
 * The 'options' attribute must be as follows:
 *   {
 *     columns: [
 *       { name: 'some-name', type: 'some-type' },
 *         :
 *     ],
 *     ?onSubmit: function () {
 *       // Generally, submit the created filter to the server
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * All and only HTML5 input types can be used as column types.
 * Normally, it is best to use 'text' as it is the most flexible, and we won't
 * really care about validation.
 *
 * Presently we do not support custom operators. However, we will do so in the
 * future.
 * TODO Support custom operators
 *
 * The 'filters' attribute must be as follows:
 *   [
 *     { column: 'some-column-name', values: [val1, ...], op: 'some-op' },
 *       :
 *   ]
 *
 * This attribute holds the current filters applied (represented as JSON), and
 * also serves to restore filters from some saved state. At the very least, it
 * must be an empty array.
